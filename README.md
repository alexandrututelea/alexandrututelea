## About me:
Hello! I`m Alexandru Tutelea, a self-taught aspiring Python developer with a pasion for databases and backend development.
I studied Information Technology in high school and earned a Technical Operator in Computing diploma. However,
i never worked in IT professionally. 
Instead i pursued political studies in college but decided not to complete my degree as it didn`t align with my interests.
For the past 13 years, I`ve been running a successfull seabuckthorn bio-farm, and three years ago I co-founded a flower-workshop with my wife, which is thriving.
While managing these businesses, I`ve always felt drawn back to my passion for technology and programming. 
Now, I`m committed to transitioning into a remote IT career, focusing on Python and databases.

## What I`m learning:
   - I am currently learning Python through the "100 Days of Code: The complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Angela Yu. I`m passionate about improving my skills
  and building projects to apply what i learn. This repository showcases my progress and projects as i go through the course.
  - I am practicing problem-solving on Codewars( 6 Kyu )
  - Building small projects to reinforce my knowledge.
  - Starting to learn SQL database management.
